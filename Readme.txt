# Campus Trade Hub — Frontend Prototype
This is a **frontend-only** demo of a campus trading system. It stores items in the browser's `localStorage` (no backend).

## How to run
1. Download and unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Post items using **Quick Post** or **Post a New Item**.
4. Use **Export** to download your items as JSON, and **Import** to load them later.

## Notes
- No login, no real payments — it's a prototype for presentation.
- Footer credits: **kudus and fatima**.
- Color theme: indigo × amber on deep navy.
